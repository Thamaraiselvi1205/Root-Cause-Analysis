**Root Cause Analysis & Process Improvement
Project Quote Handling and Communication Workflow**

**1. Executive Summary**
This analytical report presents a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of inefficiencies observed in the project quote handling and communication process within a project-based organization. The analysis identifies systemic issues related to process gaps, unclear ownership, communication breakdowns, and lack of tracking mechanisms. Based on the findings, a structured, low-cost, and scalable solution framework is proposed to improve operational efficiency, accountability, and conversion rates.

All information has been anonymized and modified for portfolio demonstration purposes.

**2. Background & Business Context**

The organization operates in a competitive, project-driven environment where timely quotation, accurate communication, and effective follow-up are critical to converting enquiries into awarded projects. Over time, recurring delays, missed communications, and inconsistent responses were observed during the quotation lifecycle. These issues negatively impacted customer experience, internal coordination, and project conversion performance.

**3. Problem Statement**

The organization experiences frequent delays and inefficiencies in project quote handling, primarily due to unstructured workflows, lack of accountability, and absence of centralized tracking. These challenges result in missed deadlines, communication gaps, and increased project drop-offs.

**4. Objectives of the Analysis**

Identify root causes behind delays and inefficiencies

Categorize issues across process, people, technology, data, and governance

Propose practical and implementable solutions

Improve visibility, accountability, and turnaround time

**5. Methodology**

The analysis was conducted using standard business analysis techniques:

Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram to categorize causes

5 Whys Analysis to identify underlying systemic issues

Process observation to understand actual workflow practices

**6. Root Cause Analysis Findings**
6.1 Process-Related Issues

Absence of a standardized workflow for enquiry and quote assignment

No defined turnaround time (TAT) for quote preparation

Lack of escalation mechanisms for delayed responses

Impact:
Inconsistent response times and uncertainty regarding task completion.

6.2 People-Related Issues

No clearly defined ownership for enquiries and quotations

Shared responsibilities leading to accountability gaps

Dependency on a few individuals for approvals and follow-ups

Impact:
Delays caused by assumed responsibility rather than assigned ownership.

6.3 Tools & Technology Issues

Use of shared email accounts for all project communications

No centralized CRM or tracking tool

Lack of dashboards to monitor enquiry or quote status

Impact:
Missed emails, duplication of effort, and poor visibility into progress.

6.4 Data-Related Issues

Inconsistent formats for enquiry and project data

Duplicate or incomplete records

No single source of truth for historical project information

Impact:
Rework, errors, and difficulty in data-driven decision-making.

6.5 Communication Issues

Multiple teams accessing the same inbox

No acknowledgment mechanism for task receipt

Communication spread across email, WhatsApp, and calls

Impact:
High probability of information loss and follow-up failures.

6.6 Management & Governance Issues

No defined KPIs for quote turnaround or conversion rates

Limited visibility into operational bottlenecks

Absence of structured MIS reporting

Impact:
Reactive issue resolution instead of proactive performance management.

**7. Consolidated Root Causes**

The core root causes identified are:

Lack of structured workflows

Absence of ownership and accountability

Ineffective communication tools

Poor data governance

No performance monitoring framework

**8. Proposed Solution Framework**
8.1 Individual Email Ownership

Implement official individual email IDs to replace shared inbox usage.

Benefit:
Improves accountability, traceability, and communication clarity.

8.2 Standardized Quote Assignment Workflow

Define a clear workflow from enquiry receipt to quote submission, with assigned owners.

Benefit:
Eliminates ambiguity and ensures consistent handling.

8.3 Defined TAT & Escalation Mechanism

Set turnaround times for quote preparation and escalation rules for delays.

Benefit:
Drives accountability and timely completion.

8.4 Centralized Tracking Dashboard

Develop a centralized Excel-based or CRM dashboard to track enquiry status, ownership, and ageing.

Benefit:
Provides a single source of truth and improves management visibility.

8.5 KPI & MIS Reporting

Define KPIs such as:

Quote turnaround time

Enquiry-to-award conversion rate

Dropped project analysis

Benefit:
Enables proactive monitoring and continuous improvement.

**9. Expected Business Impact**

Reduced quote turnaround time

Improved accountability and ownership

Higher enquiry-to-award conversion rates

Enhanced visibility for management decision-making

Reduced dependency on individuals

**10. Tools & Techniques Used**

**11. Conclusion**

This analysis demonstrates how structured root cause analysis combined with practical process improvements can significantly enhance operational efficiency without immediate reliance on complex systems. The proposed framework provides a scalable foundation for improved communication, accountability, and data-driven decision-making in a project-based organization.
